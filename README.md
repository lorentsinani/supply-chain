# Project Supply Chain

This project is an example of a supply chain / simple payment which we can use even in real world.

## Installation

First ensure you are in the directory. Ensure that you have installed required dependencies.

Ensure that you are in [Truffle Directory](./truffle). Run `truffle develop` where you will have 10 wallets with 100 eth each and private keys which you can import into your metamask. After the accounts are shown in terminal please run `migrate` in the truffle env that you are. This command will deploy contracts and you will have a directory in `src` which will be named contracts after this you can proceed into running the app like below.

Change directory to [Client Directory](./client) and start react dev server like below:

```sh
$ cd client
$ npm start
```

## FAQ

- __How do I use this with Ganache (or any other network)?__

  The Truffle project is set to deploy to Ganache by default. If you'd like to change this, it's as easy as modifying the Truffle config file! Check out [our documentation on adding network configurations](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/reference/configuration/#networks). From there, you can run `truffle migrate` pointed to another network, restart the React dev server, and see the change take place.

- __Where can I find more resources?__

  This Box is a sweet combo of [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org). Either one would be a great place to start!
